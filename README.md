# Game Controller
This repository contains the firmware implementation of an arduino-based game controller. The game controller exists as a cheap and fun way to operate PC racing games with the integrated accelerometer allowing steering input. The embedded programming was accomplished via C++ while the controller mapping was done through python.

The mp4 files in the repository describe the functionality of the controller in greater depth.
  * GameControllerLayout: describes the layout of the controller
  * GameControllerGameplay: describes how the controller plays
  * GameControllerHotkey: describes the programmable keys on the controller than can be updated via the python script provided

The controller was tested on driving-based games including TrackMania and Rocket League.
